/* A wrapper class to create and spawn a thread.  It is a base class.
   ThreadIf::thread() is a pure virtual method .

   <P>Usage:
   To use this class, derive from it and override the thread() method.
   To start the thread, call the run() method.  The code in thread() will
   run in a separate thread.

   <P>Call shutdown() from the constructing thread to shut down the
   code.  This will set the bool shutdown_ to true.  The code in
   thread() should react properly to shutdown_ being set, by
   returning.  Call join() to join the code.
   <P>Sample:
   <PRE>
   ...
   DerivedThreadIf thread;
   thread.run();
   ... do stuff ...
   thread.shutdown();
   thread.join();
   </PRE>
